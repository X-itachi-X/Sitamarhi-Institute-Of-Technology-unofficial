                    <li align="left">Lord Mahavira was born to King Siddhartha of Kundagrama and Queen Trishala, a Lichchhavi princess in the year 540 BC in the Vajji kingdom, identical with modern day Vaishali in Bihar.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Mahavira belonged to the Ikshvaku dynasty.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">There are several historians who believe that he was born in a place called Ahalya bhumi and the land has not been plowed for hundreds of years by the family that owns it.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Lord Mahavir was named Vardhamana, which means “one who grows”.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">He abandoned the worldly life at the age of 30 and attained ‘kaivalya’ or omniscience at the age of 42.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Mahavira taught ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity) and aparigraha (non-attachment) to his disciples and his teachings were called Jain Agamas. Ordinary people were able to understand the teachings of Mahavira and his followers because they used Prakrit.</li>
