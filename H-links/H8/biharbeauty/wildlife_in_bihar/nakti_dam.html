                  <ul style="font-size:14px">
                    <li align="left">The two sanctuaries at Nagi Dam and Nakti Dam are so near to one another that they can be considered one bird area.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">The Nagi-Nakti Bird Sanctuary is situated in south Bihar’s Jhajha Jamui district, close to the Jharkhand border.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">On February 25, 1984, Nagi Bird Sanctuary was designated a bird sanctuary in accordance with Section 18 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">According to a report by Wetlands International, 1,600 bar-headed geese, or about 3% of the species’ global population, have been spotted here. As a result of this unusual occurrence, Birdlife International, a global organisation, has designated the Nagi Dam Bird Sanctuary as an important bird area and held that it is vital for the conservation of the world’s bird population.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">The area of the sanctuary is 2.1 square kilometres. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Over 136 species of birds have been spotted at these sanctuaries.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">During the winter, thousands of migratory birds congregate in the reservoir, particularly from November to February. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Some of these species found in the Nagi- Nakti Bird Sanctuaries are from Eurasia, Central Asia, the Arctic Circle, Russia and Northern China.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Other major birds: Indian Courser, Indian Sandgrouse, Yellow-wattled Lapwing and Indian Robin.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Major threats to the biodiversity of the sanctuaries: Agricultural runoff; Land dispute between Irrigation and Forest Departments; Leasing out of the site for fishing.</li>
