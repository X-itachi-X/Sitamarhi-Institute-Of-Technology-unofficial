                    <li align="left">Bhimbandh is located west of Santhal Pargana, north of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, and south of the Ganges River. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">The wildlife sanctuary was established in 1976.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">It is located near Bhagalpur and spans a vast area with a surface size of over 682 square kilometres. It also has non-forest areas that are heavily populated on all sides. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">The majority of the Bhimbandh Sanctuary’s terrain is made up of a cockling length of knolls, which offers a stunning view. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">The Bhimbandh Sanctuary is easily reachable from any far-flung corner of the country because it is situated about 56 kilometres from the district of Munger toward its southwestern border.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">There are several hot water springs that maintain nearly the same temperature all year round, the best of which may be found in Bhimbandh, Sita Kund, and Rishi Kund. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">The Bhimbandh springs, which have the highest temperatures (52 to 65 °C) and the highest flow rates (0.84 to 1.12 cubic/sec), are the finest location to explore the possibilities for geothermal energy.</li>
