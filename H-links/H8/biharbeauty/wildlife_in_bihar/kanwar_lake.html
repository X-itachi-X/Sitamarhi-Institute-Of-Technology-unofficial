                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Locally known as Kanwar Jheel, it is situated 22 kilometres northwest of Begusarai town in Manjhaul.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">It was created by the geological meandering of the Burhi Gandak river, a tributary of the Ganga.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">It was designated as Bihar’s first Ramsar site by the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in November 2020.</li>

                    <li align="left">Five critically endangered species inhabit the site, including three vultures – the red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) and Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) – and two waterbirds, the sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius) and Baer’s pochard (Aythya baeri). </li>
