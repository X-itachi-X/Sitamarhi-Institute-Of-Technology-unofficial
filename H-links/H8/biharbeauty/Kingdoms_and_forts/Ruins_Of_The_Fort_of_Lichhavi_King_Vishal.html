                    <li align="left"> Historians maintain that one of the worldâ€™s first democratic republics with an elected assembly of representatives flourished here in the 6th century B.C. in the time of the Vajjis and the Lichchavis.</li>

                    <li align="left">To the north of Vaishali, an ancient city in the state of Bihar, India, is located a huge mound of 6 ft x 10 ft high, known as Raja Vishal Ka Garh.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the Raja Vishal Ka Garh is as a protected monument. Raja Vishal ka Garh, spread over 81 acres and which has a mound near Vaishali village that is believed to be the remains of an ancient parliament house, has thrown up some more remarkable secrets recently</li>

                    <br>
                    <li align="left">The excavation has revealed clear traces of human settlement till the Shunga period (185-73 BC), ASI has found terracotta figurines, shiny pottery shards and punched copper coins, which could date back to 600 BC when Vaishali used to be a power centre of the Lichchhavi Republic.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Excavation has also yielded terracotta figurines of snakes, elephants and dogs, of deer horns belonging to the Gupta, Kushan and Shunga periods. A cylindrical gold bead from the Kushan period has also been discovered.</li>
