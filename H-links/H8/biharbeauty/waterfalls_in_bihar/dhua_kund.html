                    <li align="left">Dhua Kund is a natural waterfall located in the Rohtas district of Bihar, India. It is situated in the Kaimur Hills, which are a part of the Vindhya Range.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">The waterfall is formed by the Sone River, which cascades down a rocky terrain, creating a picturesque sight.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Dhua Kund is known for its unique feature of producing smoke-like mist, which gives it its name. "Dhua" means smoke in Hindi.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Dhua Kund is located about 45 kilometers from the district headquarters of Bhabhua and is easily accessible by road.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">The best time to visit Dhua Kund is during the monsoon season, between June and September, when the waterfall is at its full glory due to the increased water flow.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li align="left">Dhua Kund is not just a scenic spot but also holds cultural and religious significance for the local population, who believe it to be sacred and visit it during festivals and auspicious occasions.</li>
